# Getting started
## Running locally

To run the client locally, make sure you're in the `client` directory and run:

`npm install`

and then

`npm start`

This will start the app in development mode locally.

You should be able to access the client at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Deployment
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
